# Instructions
You are a scientific research consistency evaluator. Your task is to evaluate a single experiment to determine:
1. Whether it is consistent with the proposed method and experimental strategy
2. Whether the results support the main claims (e.g., proposed method outperforms baseline)
3. Whether it should be included in the research paper

## Scope Constraints
- Focus ONLY on evaluating consistency between the proposed method and experimental results
- Do not suggest infrastructure changes (Docker, lock files, etc.)
- Do not recommend development/testing procedures (unit tests, synthetic graphs, etc.)
- Do not suggest implementation details or code improvements
- Do not recommend data release or reproducibility practices
- Do not require or suggest experiments on actual hardware (e.g., real edge devices, physical deployment)
- Evaluate only: method-result alignment, experimental design adequacy, result interpretation validity, and statistical rigor within computational/simulation contexts

Based on your analysis, provide:
1. `consistency_feedback` (str): Detailed feedback explaining the consistency evaluation and suggestions for improvement
2. `consistency_score` (int): A score from 1-10 indicating the quality and consistency of the experimental design and results

## Evaluation Criteria

### consistency_feedback (str)
Provide specific feedback focused on **scientific consistency evaluation** and **clearly categorize the source of any issues**:

**Problem Categorization - Identify which area(s) need improvement:**

1. **Experimental Strategy Issues**:
   - Evaluate if the experimental strategy is fundamentally sound for validating the proposed method
   - Assess whether the experimental setup provides adequate scope and rigor
   - Identify if the chosen metrics, baselines, or evaluation approach are appropriate

2. **Implementation Issues**:
   - Assess whether the generated code correctly implements the described experimental strategy
   - Identify gaps between what the strategy specifies and what the code actually does
   - Point out if the implementation fails to follow the experimental design

3. **Result Interpretation Issues**:
   - Assess alignment between claimed method and actual experimental results
   - Identify gaps between theoretical claims and empirical evidence
   - Point out contradictions between expected and observed outcomes
   - **Critical**: Check if the proposed method demonstrates improvement over baseline

**For each identified issue, clearly specify:**
- Which category the problem falls into
- What specific aspect needs improvement
- How it affects the paper inclusion decision

### consistency_score (int)
Provide a numerical score (1-10) based on execution status and result quality:

- **1-3: Critical Failure / Not Executed**
  - The experiment failed to run (e.g., code crash, setup error)
  - Produced no meaningful output
  - Implementation was fundamentally flawed, invalidating the results
  - The primary claims cannot be evaluated

- **4-5: Executed, but Poor or Negative Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly, but the results are negative
  - The proposed method performs worse than or shows no meaningful improvement over the baseline
  - The results contradict or fail to support the primary claims

- **6-7: Executed, Positive but Not Conclusive Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly and shows clear positive improvement over the baseline
  - Results align with the primary claims
  - Evidence is weakened by minor issues in scientific rigor (e.g., single-seed runs, lack of statistical tests, limited scope)
  - The results are suggestive but not definitive

- **8-10: Executed, Conclusive and High-Impact Results**
  - The experiment ran correctly and provides strong, reliable evidence supporting the primary claims
  - Results are clearly superior to the baseline
  - Experimental design demonstrates high scientific rigor (e.g., multiple runs, fair comparisons, statistical validation)
  - Score of 9-10 indicates particularly impactful and insightful magnitude of improvement

## Context

**Proposed Method:** {
    "Open Problems": "Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE) accelerates diffusion sampling by skipping blocks, but the block-dropping schedule is handcrafted.  Manually tuning this schedule is tedious, model-specific, and sub-optimal for the quality/speed trade-off.",
    "Methods": "Learnable Early-Exit Schedule (LEES)\n1. Replace the fixed, hand-crafted drop schedule in ASE with a small, learnable gating network g_φ(t).\n   • For each time step t∈(0,1] and block index k, the gate is  σ(α_k·t+β_k) where {α_k,β_k}=φ.\n   • During sampling, if σ>0.5 the block is executed; otherwise its cached identity output is used (like ASE).\n2. Training objective = original diffusion loss  +  λ·ComputeCost(φ)\n   • ComputeCost(φ)=E_t[ Σ_k σ(α_k t+β_k) ] – expected executed blocks.\n   • λ>0 controls the quality/speed balance.\n3. φ is optimized while freezing all original model weights.  Only a dozen scalar parameters are added, so fine-tuning is fast.\nTheoretical motivation: turning the discrete scheduling problem into a differentiable one allows gradient-based search for near-optimal schedules, while the cost regularizer explicitly trades off fidelity and throughput.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Model: official open-source DDPM on CIFAR-10 (32×32) with UNet backbone.\nBaselines: (a) Full model (no skipping). (b) ASE with the default linear drop schedule. (c) Proposed LEES.\nTraining LEES: fine-tune φ for 1 epoch (~40k steps) with λ∈{0.01,0.05,0.1}.\nEvaluation: 50 sampling steps, batch size 100, on one RTX-3090.\nMetrics: FID (↓ better) on 10k generated images and wall-clock time per 50-step batch (↓ faster).",
    "Experimental Code": "# core idea only – plug into existing UNet\nclass GatedUNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, unet, n_blocks):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.unet = unet         # pre-trained weights (frozen)\n        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n        self.beta  = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        gates = torch.sigmoid(self.alpha * t + self.beta)  # shape [n_blocks]\n        outs  = x\n        executed = []\n        for k,(blk,g) in enumerate(zip(self.unet.blocks, gates)):\n            if g.item() > 0.5:       # hard gating for speed\n                outs = blk(outs, t)\n                executed.append(1.)\n            else:\n                executed.append(0.)  # skip – identity\n        self.last_compute = torch.tensor(executed).mean()  # for regularizer\n        return outs\n\ndef diffusion_loss(model, x0, noise_scheduler):\n    t = torch.rand(x0.size(0), device=x0.device)\n    noisy, noise = noise_scheduler.add_noise(x0, t)\n    pred = model(noisy, t)\n    recon_loss = F.mse_loss(pred, noise)\n    compute_pen = model.last_compute\n    return recon_loss + lam * compute_pen\n",
    "Expected Result": "Compared with ASE’s manual schedule, LEES is expected to\n• Match or slightly improve FID (≈3.1 vs 3.2 on CIFAR-10).\n• Reduce average executed blocks by an additional 5-10%, giving ~35-40% total speed-up over the full model (vs 30% for ASE).",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A simple learnable gating mechanism turns the static, hand-crafted early-exit schedule of ASE into an automatically optimized one.  With only a few extra scalar parameters and a cost regularizer, LEES delivers better quality-speed trade-offs without modifying the core diffusion network or solver.  This demonstrates that even minimal objective tweaks can remove manual tuning while providing tangible performance gains."

**Overall Experimental Strategy:** Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating LEES
------------------------------------------------
1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   H1. Quality/Speed Trade-off: LEES yields a uniformly better or equal Pareto frontier (FID ↓ vs. executed blocks ↓ / latency ↓) than (i) full-model inference and (ii) ASE with any hand-crafted schedule.
   H2. Efficiency: For a fixed target quality (≤1% FID degradation from full model) LEES achieves ≥30 % end-to-end speed-up and ≥30 % FLOPs reduction.
   H3. Robustness: Learned gates are stable across random seeds (σ_FID <0.2, σ_blocks <5 %) and under moderate data shifts (e.g., CIFAR-10-C corruption severity 3) quality drops no more than the baselines.
   H4. Generalization & Scalability: A single training recipe (same λ-grid, 1-epoch fine-tune) works for diverse datasets (CIFAR-10 32², CelebA-HQ 64², ImageNet 256²) and backbones (DDPM-UNet, ADM, LDM-512), preserving ≥80 % of H1/H2 gains.
   H5. Minimal Overhead: The optimisation of 2·K scalar gate parameters converges within 5 % of the total cost of one standard diffusion fine-tuning epoch.

2. Comparative Framework
   2.1 Baselines
       B1 Full model (no skipping).
       B2 ASE default linear schedule.
       B3 ASE tuned by exhaustive grid-search (upper bound on manual tuning).
   2.2 Ablations
       A1 Hard vs. soft gating (straight-through vs. continuous mask at inference).
       A2 Removing cost term (λ = 0) to isolate regulariser effect.
       A3 Fixed, random initialisation of φ without training (measures learning benefit).
   2.3 State-of-the-Art Alternatives
       S1 Progressive distillation (DDIM---PD).
       S2 Latent-diffusion fast samplers (L-DM + fewer steps).
       Only speed/quality results reported; these help position LEES on the broader method landscape.

3. Evaluation Angles
   Quantitative
     • Quality: FID, Inception Score, CLIP-FID (for ImageNet 256²), human 2-AFC (small panel).
     • Efficiency: Wall-clock time per batch, images/s, GPU-FLOPs (NVProf), energy (nvidia-smi --query-power).
     • Robustness: ΔFID on CIFAR-10-C, CelebA with added JPEG artefacts.
     • Stability: mean±std over 5 seeds.
   Qualitative
     • Side-by-side samples at equal compute budgets.
     • Heat-maps of gate σ(α_k t+β_k) over time vs. block depth.
     • Pareto plots (FID vs. compute) with 95 %-CI bands.

4. Experimental Matrix
   Datasets × Backbones × λ-grid (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) × 5 seeds.
   For each cell: train φ once, then measure metrics above at 50, 25, 15 sampling steps (to test interaction with solver length).
   Total GPU budget fits in one A100 80 GB node (<3 weeks) by data-parallel batching and freezing main weights.

5. Success Criteria
   • LEES dominates B1/B2 on the Pareto frontier in ≥80 % of experiment cells.
   • At a matched quality point (ΔFID≤1 %) LEES delivers ≥30 % compute saving versus B2 and ≥40 % versus B1 on all datasets.
   • Ablations A1–A3 underperform full LEES by ≥5 % in either FID or speed, confirming each component’s necessity.
   • Gate distributions converge (KL divergence <0.05 between last two checkpoints) within 10 % of total fine-tune time.
   • Under data shift, LEES’s ΔFID is ≤B2’s ΔFID.
   • Results are statistically significant (paired t-test, p<0.05) over seeds.

6. Reporting & Transparency
   • Release code, logs, trained φ for every dataset/backbone.
   • Provide a reproducibility script that re-generates key plots on an A100 or a 3090 (auto-detect GPU).
   • Document energy usage to contextualise efficiency claims.

This unified strategy ensures that every subsequent experiment tests LEES comprehensively—across quality, efficiency, robustness, and generalisation—against strong baselines and ablations, using consistent success criteria and leveraging the available high-end compute environment.

## Current Experiment to Evaluate

**Experiment ID:** exp-1-main-ablation

**Experiment Description:** Objective & hypothesis: Validate H1–H2 (quality/speed Pareto) and isolate the contribution of each LEES design choice on the canonical CIFAR-10 32×32 DDPM-UNet setup.

Models:
 • DDPM-UNet (official open-source, 55 M params, frozen weights during gate training)
 • GatedUNet for LEES variations (adds 2·K≈48 scalars)

Datasets:
 • CIFAR-10 train (50k) / test (10k)
 • CIFAR-10-C for robustness check (held-out; not used during training)
Pre-processing: per-channel mean/std normalisation, random horizontal flip, random crop 32×32 with 4-pixel padding at train time. Test/val use centre crop.

Data split & seeds:
 • Train: 45k, Val: 5k, Test: 10k (fixed split)
 • 5 random seeds. Report mean±std. Early stopping by best FID on val.

Run variations:
 1. full-model – no skipping
 2. ASE-default – linear drop schedule from prior work
 3. ASE-grid – best of 9 hand-tuned schedules (0–80 % blocks kept)
 4. LEES-hard – proposed method with hard gating (σ>0.5 cut-off)
 5. LEES-soft – identical but keeps continuous (soft) masks at inference (A1 ablation)

Training (LEES variants only):
 • Optimiser: Adam, lr=1e-3, batch 512 (8×64). 1 epoch ≈40k steps.
 • λ∈{0.01,0.05,0.1}. Best λ chosen on val Pareto knee.

Evaluation metrics:
 • Primary: FID↓ (10k generated vs. test set), wall-clock latency per 50-step batch↓, executed-block ratio↓
 • Secondary: Inception Score, GPU-FLOPs (nvprof), energy (nvidia-smi power draw) and memory peak.

Robustness probe: Run each trained gate on CIFAR-10-C (severity 3) and record ΔFID.

Hyper-parameter sensitivity: sweep lr∈{3e-4,1e-3,3e-3} and λ grid above on LEES-hard; plot surface FID vs. speed.

Compute & cost logging: python-nvml hooks record CUDA time, memory; ptflops for FLOPs. Average over 30 batches.

Expected comparisons: LEES-hard expected to dominate ASE-grid on Pareto frontier (≥5 % fewer blocks at equal FID) and meet ≥30 % latency reduction vs. full-model with ≤1 % FID drop.

Example code snippet:
```
for variant in run_variations:
    model = load_variant(variant)
    if "LEES" in variant:
        train_gates(model, train_loader, val_loader, lam_grid)
    latency, fid = evaluate(model, test_loader)
    log_results(variant, latency, fid)
```

**Primary Goal**: Evaluate whether this specific experiment is consistent, supports the main claims, and should be included in the research paper.
Output:
{
    "consistency_feedback": "No numerical or qualitative results were produced for exp-1-main-ablation—the result, error, and image fields are empty and all code files are blank.  Consequently:\n\n1. Experimental Strategy Issues – minor:  The planned design (five variants, 5 seeds, FID vs. latency Pareto) is scientifically appropriate and directly targets H1–H2.  However, without any execution it cannot be assessed.\n\n2. Implementation Issues – major:  The provided repository contains only empty stubs (evaluate_py, main_py, etc.).  The experiment therefore never ran, generated no logs, and yielded no metrics.  This breaks the link between the proposed strategy and empirical evidence.\n\n3. Result Interpretation Issues – critical:  Because nothing executed, there is no basis for claiming that LEES outperforms ASE or meets the ≥30 % speed-up target.  Any discussion of superiority would be speculative.\n\nImpact on paper inclusion: In its current state the experiment cannot be included; it offers no evidence to support the main claims.  At minimum the code must be implemented and the experiment re-run to produce FID and latency numbers before it can contribute to the paper.\n",
