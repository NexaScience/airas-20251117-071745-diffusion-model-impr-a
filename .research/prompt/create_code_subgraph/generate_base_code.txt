Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher preparing the COMMON CORE FOUNDATION for experiments that will ensure consistency across all experimental variations.

This step generates the **COMMON CORE FOUNDATION** for experiments that will ensure consistency across all experimental variations.

**Current Task**: Generate common base logic, evaluation framework, and infrastructure with placeholders for specific datasets/models
**Next Step**: A subsequent step will derive specific experiments by replacing placeholders with actual datasets/models

Based on the research method in # Current Research Method and experimental design in # Experimental Design, generate the foundational code that will serve as the common base for ALL experimental variations.

# Instructions: Common Core Foundation Generation

## Core Requirements
- **COMMON EVALUATION LOGIC**: Implement consistent evaluation metrics, result collection, and comparison logic that will work across all experimental variations
- **CORE ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION**: Implement the main method/algorithm with full functionality
- **INFRASTRUCTURE CODE**: Complete training loops, model saving/loading, configuration handling, and result visualization
- **PLACEHOLDER STRATEGY**: Use clear, descriptive placeholders for dataset-specific and model-specific components that will be replaced in subsequent steps
- **CONSISTENCY FRAMEWORK**: Ensure all experiments will use identical evaluation criteria, metrics calculation, and result formatting

## Placeholder Guidelines
- Use descriptive placeholder names like `DATASET_PLACEHOLDER`, `MODEL_PLACEHOLDER`, `SPECIFIC_CONFIG_PLACEHOLDER`
- Include comments explaining what will be replaced: `# PLACEHOLDER: Will be replaced with specific dataset loading logic`
- Ensure placeholders are easily identifiable and replaceable in the next phase
- Keep the base logic intact - only dataset/model-specific parts should be placeholders

## Implementation Requirements
- **ZERO PLACEHOLDER POLICY FOR CORE LOGIC**: Generate complete, production-ready base framework. NO placeholders for training loops, evaluation logic, or result processing.
- **COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION**: Every base component must be fully functional. No "omitted for brevity", no "simplified version" for base logic.
- **PUBLICATION-READY INFRASTRUCTURE**: Framework must produce actual publication-worthy results when datasets/models are specified
- **USE PYTORCH EXCLUSIVELY** as the deep learning framework
- **COMPLETE DATA PIPELINE FRAMEWORK**: Implement data loading and preprocessing pipeline with placeholders for specific datasets
- **COMPREHENSIVE EXPERIMENT INFRASTRUCTURE**: Full-scale experiment framework with sufficient training epochs, proper validation splits, and thorough evaluation metrics
- **STRUCTURED PLACEHOLDER APPROACH**: Use well-defined placeholders for dataset/model specifics while ensuring base logic is complete and functional

## Standard Output Content Requirements
- Experiment description: Before printing experimental results, the standard output must include a detailed description of the experiment.
- Experimental numerical data: All experimental data obtained in the experiments must be output to the standard output.
- Names of figures summarizing the numerical data

## Figure Output Requirements
- Experimental results must always be presented in clear and interpretable figures without exception.
- Use matplotlib or seaborn to output the results (e.g., accuracy, loss curves, confusion matrix).
- Numeric values must be annotated on the axes of the graphs.
- For line graphs, annotate significant values (e.g., the final or best value) to highlight key findings. For bar graphs, annotate the value above each bar.
- Include legends in the figures.
- To prevent labels, titles, and legends from overlapping, use `plt.tight_layout()` before saving the figure.
- All figures must be saved to `{results_dir}/images/` directory in .pdf format (e.g., using `plt.savefig(os.path.join(results_dir, "images", "filename.pdf"), bbox_inches="tight")`).
  - Do not use .png or any other formats—only .pdf is acceptable for publication quality.

## Figure Naming Convention
File names must follow the format: `<figure_topic>[_<condition>][_pairN].pdf`
- `<figure_topic>`: The main subject of the figure (e.g., training_loss, accuracy, inference_latency)
- `_<condition>` (optional): Indicates model, setting, or comparison condition (e.g., amict, baseline, tokens, multimodal_vs_text)
- `_pairN` (optional): Used when presenting figures in pairs (e.g., _pair1, _pair2)
- For standalone figures, do not include _pairN.


- Environment Variables: The following environment variables are available: HF_TOKEN, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY


## Command Line Interface and Run Variations
The `full_experiment.yaml` file defines a list of all experiments to be run (e.g., baseline, proposed, ablations). The `main.py` script reads this file and executes experiments sequentially.

The generated main.py must support:
```bash
# Smoke test (runs a lightweight version of ALL run variations defined in smoke_test.yaml)
uv run python -m src.main --smoke-test --results-dir <path>

# Full experiment (reads full_experiment.yaml, runs all variations sequentially)
uv run python -m src.main --full-experiment --results-dir <path>
```

The `--results-dir` argument is passed from the GitHub Actions workflow and specifies where all outputs (figures, logs, metrics) should be saved.

## Output Structure
Generate complete foundational code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:

### Script Structure (ExperimentCode format)
Generate complete foundational code for these files ONLY. Do not create any additional files beyond this structure:
- `src/train.py`: Logic to run a single experiment variation. It is called as a subprocess by main.py. It must save final metrics to a structured file (e.g., results.json).
- `src/evaluate.py`: Comparison and visualization tool. It reads the result files from all experiment variations and generates comparison figures.
- `src/preprocess.py`: Common preprocessing pipeline with dataset placeholders
- `src/model.py`: Model architecture implementations. It will contain classes for baseline, proposed, and ablation models.
- `src/main.py`: The main orchestrator script. It reads a config file, launches train.py for each experiment sequentially, manages subprocesses, collects and consolidates logs, and finally triggers evaluate.py.
- `pyproject.toml`: Complete project dependencies
- `config/smoke_test.yaml`: Configuration file template with placeholder structure for run variations. Actual variations will be populated in derive_specific step.
- `config/full_experiment.yaml`: Configuration file template with placeholder structure for run variations. Actual variations will be populated in derive_specific step.

### Key Implementation Focus Areas
1. Algorithm Core: Full implementation of the proposed method with proper abstraction
2. Sequential Execution: main.py executes run variations one at a time in sequential order.
3. Configuration Driven: The entire workflow must be driven by the YAML configuration files.
4. Evaluation Consistency: Identical metrics calculation, result formatting, and comparison logic. evaluate.py must operate on the saved results after all training is complete.
5. Structured Logging:
   - train.py: Print JSON-formatted experimental data (epoch-wise metrics, final results) to stdout using `print(json.dumps({...}))`. Always include `"run_id"` field (use the run variation name from config).
   - evaluate.py: Print JSON-formatted comparison results to stdout
   - main.py: For each subprocess, redirect stdout/stderr to `{results_dir}/{run_id}/stdout.log` and `{results_dir}/{run_id}/stderr.log` while also forwarding to main process stdout/stderr (using tee-like logic) so logs are captured both structurally and by GitHub Actions.

    "Open Problems": "Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE) accelerates diffusion sampling by skipping blocks, but the block-dropping schedule is handcrafted.  Manually tuning this schedule is tedious, model-specific, and sub-optimal for the quality/speed trade-off.",
    "Methods": "Learnable Early-Exit Schedule (LEES)\n1. Replace the fixed, hand-crafted drop schedule in ASE with a small, learnable gating network g_φ(t).\n   • For each time step t∈(0,1] and block index k, the gate is  σ(α_k·t+β_k) where {α_k,β_k}=φ.\n   • During sampling, if σ>0.5 the block is executed; otherwise its cached identity output is used (like ASE).\n2. Training objective = original diffusion loss  +  λ·ComputeCost(φ)\n   • ComputeCost(φ)=E_t[ Σ_k σ(α_k t+β_k) ] – expected executed blocks.\n   • λ>0 controls the quality/speed balance.\n3. φ is optimized while freezing all original model weights.  Only a dozen scalar parameters are added, so fine-tuning is fast.\nTheoretical motivation: turning the discrete scheduling problem into a differentiable one allows gradient-based search for near-optimal schedules, while the cost regularizer explicitly trades off fidelity and throughput.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Model: official open-source DDPM on CIFAR-10 (32×32) with UNet backbone.\nBaselines: (a) Full model (no skipping). (b) ASE with the default linear drop schedule. (c) Proposed LEES.\nTraining LEES: fine-tune φ for 1 epoch (~40k steps) with λ∈{0.01,0.05,0.1}.\nEvaluation: 50 sampling steps, batch size 100, on one RTX-3090.\nMetrics: FID (↓ better) on 10k generated images and wall-clock time per 50-step batch (↓ faster).",
    "Experimental Code": "# core idea only – plug into existing UNet\nclass GatedUNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, unet, n_blocks):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.unet = unet         # pre-trained weights (frozen)\n        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n        self.beta  = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        gates = torch.sigmoid(self.alpha * t + self.beta)  # shape [n_blocks]\n        outs  = x\n        executed = []\n        for k,(blk,g) in enumerate(zip(self.unet.blocks, gates)):\n            if g.item() > 0.5:       # hard gating for speed\n                outs = blk(outs, t)\n                executed.append(1.)\n            else:\n                executed.append(0.)  # skip – identity\n        self.last_compute = torch.tensor(executed).mean()  # for regularizer\n        return outs\n\ndef diffusion_loss(model, x0, noise_scheduler):\n    t = torch.rand(x0.size(0), device=x0.device)\n    noisy, noise = noise_scheduler.add_noise(x0, t)\n    pred = model(noisy, t)\n    recon_loss = F.mse_loss(pred, noise)\n    compute_pen = model.last_compute\n    return recon_loss + lam * compute_pen\n",
    "Expected Result": "Compared with ASE’s manual schedule, LEES is expected to\n• Match or slightly improve FID (≈3.1 vs 3.2 on CIFAR-10).\n• Reduce average executed blocks by an additional 5-10%, giving ~35-40% total speed-up over the full model (vs 30% for ASE).",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A simple learnable gating mechanism turns the static, hand-crafted early-exit schedule of ASE into an automatically optimized one.  With only a few extra scalar parameters and a cost regularizer, LEES delivers better quality-speed trade-offs without modifying the core diffusion network or solver.  This demonstrates that even minimal objective tweaks can remove manual tuning while providing tangible performance gains."

# Experimental Design
- Strategy: Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating LEES
------------------------------------------------
1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   H1. Quality/Speed Trade-off: LEES yields a uniformly better or equal Pareto frontier (FID ↓ vs. executed blocks ↓ / latency ↓) than (i) full-model inference and (ii) ASE with any hand-crafted schedule.
   H2. Efficiency: For a fixed target quality (≤1% FID degradation from full model) LEES achieves ≥30 % end-to-end speed-up and ≥30 % FLOPs reduction.
   H3. Robustness: Learned gates are stable across random seeds (σ_FID <0.2, σ_blocks <5 %) and under moderate data shifts (e.g., CIFAR-10-C corruption severity 3) quality drops no more than the baselines.
   H4. Generalization & Scalability: A single training recipe (same λ-grid, 1-epoch fine-tune) works for diverse datasets (CIFAR-10 32², CelebA-HQ 64², ImageNet 256²) and backbones (DDPM-UNet, ADM, LDM-512), preserving ≥80 % of H1/H2 gains.
   H5. Minimal Overhead: The optimisation of 2·K scalar gate parameters converges within 5 % of the total cost of one standard diffusion fine-tuning epoch.

2. Comparative Framework
   2.1 Baselines
       B1 Full model (no skipping).
       B2 ASE default linear schedule.
       B3 ASE tuned by exhaustive grid-search (upper bound on manual tuning).
   2.2 Ablations
       A1 Hard vs. soft gating (straight-through vs. continuous mask at inference).
       A2 Removing cost term (λ = 0) to isolate regulariser effect.
       A3 Fixed, random initialisation of φ without training (measures learning benefit).
   2.3 State-of-the-Art Alternatives
       S1 Progressive distillation (DDIM---PD).
       S2 Latent-diffusion fast samplers (L-DM + fewer steps).
       Only speed/quality results reported; these help position LEES on the broader method landscape.

3. Evaluation Angles
   Quantitative
     • Quality: FID, Inception Score, CLIP-FID (for ImageNet 256²), human 2-AFC (small panel).
     • Efficiency: Wall-clock time per batch, images/s, GPU-FLOPs (NVProf), energy (nvidia-smi --query-power).
     • Robustness: ΔFID on CIFAR-10-C, CelebA with added JPEG artefacts.
     • Stability: mean±std over 5 seeds.
   Qualitative
     • Side-by-side samples at equal compute budgets.
     • Heat-maps of gate σ(α_k t+β_k) over time vs. block depth.
     • Pareto plots (FID vs. compute) with 95 %-CI bands.

4. Experimental Matrix
   Datasets × Backbones × λ-grid (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) × 5 seeds.
   For each cell: train φ once, then measure metrics above at 50, 25, 15 sampling steps (to test interaction with solver length).
   Total GPU budget fits in one A100 80 GB node (<3 weeks) by data-parallel batching and freezing main weights.

5. Success Criteria
   • LEES dominates B1/B2 on the Pareto frontier in ≥80 % of experiment cells.
   • At a matched quality point (ΔFID≤1 %) LEES delivers ≥30 % compute saving versus B2 and ≥40 % versus B1 on all datasets.
   • Ablations A1–A3 underperform full LEES by ≥5 % in either FID or speed, confirming each component’s necessity.
   • Gate distributions converge (KL divergence <0.05 between last two checkpoints) within 10 % of total fine-tune time.
   • Under data shift, LEES’s ΔFID is ≤B2’s ΔFID.
   • Results are statistically significant (paired t-test, p<0.05) over seeds.

6. Reporting & Transparency
   • Release code, logs, trained φ for every dataset/backbone.
   • Provide a reproducibility script that re-generates key plots on an A100 or a 3090 (auto-detect GPU).
   • Document energy usage to contextualise efficiency claims.

This unified strategy ensures that every subsequent experiment tests LEES comprehensively—across quality, efficiency, robustness, and generalisation—against strong baselines and ablations, using consistent success criteria and leveraging the available high-end compute environment.
