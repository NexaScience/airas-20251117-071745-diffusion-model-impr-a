Input:
You are a cutting-edge AI researcher. Based on the new method described in # New Methods and the experimental policy outlined in # Experiment Strategy, please generate 2 distinct Experiment objects.

# Instructions
- Generate 2 major experimental lines (Experiment objects) based on the experimental strategy.
- Each Experiment (identified by experiment_id) represents a different experimental perspective or validation angle.
- Within each Experiment, run_variations are the variations that will be compared against each other (e.g., ["baseline", "proposed"], ["full-method", "ablation-A", "ablation-B"]).
- Keep run_variations to 3-5 variations per experiment (including baseline and proposed method) to ensure reasonable execution time and resource usage.
- Each Experiment should:
    - Have a unique experiment_id (e.g., "exp-1", "exp-2", "exp-3")
    - Have a clear description of its objective or hypothesis
    - Have a list of run_variations that will be compared within this experiment
    - Cover different aspects of validating the proposed method
- The experiments should be complementary and cover various validation angles such as:
    - Main performance validation
    - Ablation studies
    - Robustness tests
    - Comparison with baselines
    - Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis
    - Computational efficiency analysis
- Each experiment will have its own GitHub branch and code.
- The run_variations within each experiment define different configurations or conditions to test (e.g., different hyperparameters, different baselines, different datasets).

- Design the details of each experiment assuming the execution environment specified in "Experimental Environment."
- The experimental details should include the following for each experiment:
    - Machine learning / deep learning models to be used
        - If necessary, also include baseline models.
    - Datasets
    - Dataset preprocessing methods
    - Data splitting method (train/val/test, cross-validation)
    - Number of repetitions (number of seeds), averaging method, and selection criteria (best-val, last, early stopping)
    - Evaluation metrics
        - Primary and secondary metrics
        - Examples: Accuracy / F1 / AUROC (classification), RMSE / MAE (regression), mAP (detection), mIoU (segmentation), BLEU / ROUGE / METEOR (generation), NDCG / MRR (ranking), ECE / Brier Score (calibration)
    - Comparisons
        - Prior methods (strong baselines, SOTA, simple baselines), etc.
        - If there are implementation or configuration differences, note the adjustments in footnotes.
    - Methods for analyzing important hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, temperature, k, thresholds)
    - Methods for assessing robustness
        - Resistance to noise injection, distribution shift (OOD), adversarial perturbations, and domain transfer
    - Computation of FLOPs, training/inference time, memory usage, and cost / wall-clock time
    - Example experimental code
- Avoid excessive redundancy across experiments. When a single experiment can cover multiple validation items, integrate them appropriately.
- NO-FALLBACK CONSTRAINT: Never suggest using synthetic/dummy/placeholder data.
- Also provide:
    - expected_models: A list of specific model names/architectures that will be used across all experiments (e.g., ["ResNet-50", "BERT-base", "GPT-3.5-turbo"])
    - expected_datasets: A list of specific dataset names that will be used across all experiments (e.g., ["CIFAR-10", "ImageNet", "IMDB Reviews"])

    - experiment_id: Unique identifier
    - run_variations: List of variation names/identifiers for this experiment

    "Open Problems": "Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE) accelerates diffusion sampling by skipping blocks, but the block-dropping schedule is handcrafted.  Manually tuning this schedule is tedious, model-specific, and sub-optimal for the quality/speed trade-off.",
    "Methods": "Learnable Early-Exit Schedule (LEES)\n1. Replace the fixed, hand-crafted drop schedule in ASE with a small, learnable gating network g_φ(t).\n   • For each time step t∈(0,1] and block index k, the gate is  σ(α_k·t+β_k) where {α_k,β_k}=φ.\n   • During sampling, if σ>0.5 the block is executed; otherwise its cached identity output is used (like ASE).\n2. Training objective = original diffusion loss  +  λ·ComputeCost(φ)\n   • ComputeCost(φ)=E_t[ Σ_k σ(α_k t+β_k) ] – expected executed blocks.\n   • λ>0 controls the quality/speed balance.\n3. φ is optimized while freezing all original model weights.  Only a dozen scalar parameters are added, so fine-tuning is fast.\nTheoretical motivation: turning the discrete scheduling problem into a differentiable one allows gradient-based search for near-optimal schedules, while the cost regularizer explicitly trades off fidelity and throughput.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Model: official open-source DDPM on CIFAR-10 (32×32) with UNet backbone.\nBaselines: (a) Full model (no skipping). (b) ASE with the default linear drop schedule. (c) Proposed LEES.\nTraining LEES: fine-tune φ for 1 epoch (~40k steps) with λ∈{0.01,0.05,0.1}.\nEvaluation: 50 sampling steps, batch size 100, on one RTX-3090.\nMetrics: FID (↓ better) on 10k generated images and wall-clock time per 50-step batch (↓ faster).",
    "Experimental Code": "# core idea only – plug into existing UNet\nclass GatedUNet(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, unet, n_blocks):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.unet = unet         # pre-trained weights (frozen)\n        self.alpha = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n        self.beta  = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(n_blocks))\n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        gates = torch.sigmoid(self.alpha * t + self.beta)  # shape [n_blocks]\n        outs  = x\n        executed = []\n        for k,(blk,g) in enumerate(zip(self.unet.blocks, gates)):\n            if g.item() > 0.5:       # hard gating for speed\n                outs = blk(outs, t)\n                executed.append(1.)\n            else:\n                executed.append(0.)  # skip – identity\n        self.last_compute = torch.tensor(executed).mean()  # for regularizer\n        return outs\n\ndef diffusion_loss(model, x0, noise_scheduler):\n    t = torch.rand(x0.size(0), device=x0.device)\n    noisy, noise = noise_scheduler.add_noise(x0, t)\n    pred = model(noisy, t)\n    recon_loss = F.mse_loss(pred, noise)\n    compute_pen = model.last_compute\n    return recon_loss + lam * compute_pen\n",
    "Expected Result": "Compared with ASE’s manual schedule, LEES is expected to\n• Match or slightly improve FID (≈3.1 vs 3.2 on CIFAR-10).\n• Reduce average executed blocks by an additional 5-10%, giving ~35-40% total speed-up over the full model (vs 30% for ASE).",
    "Expected Conclusion": "A simple learnable gating mechanism turns the static, hand-crafted early-exit schedule of ASE into an automatically optimized one.  With only a few extra scalar parameters and a cost regularizer, LEES delivers better quality-speed trade-offs without modifying the core diffusion network or solver.  This demonstrates that even minimal objective tweaks can remove manual tuning while providing tangible performance gains."

# Experiment Strategy
Overall Experimental Strategy for Validating LEES
------------------------------------------------
1. Core Hypotheses to Validate
   H1. Quality/Speed Trade-off: LEES yields a uniformly better or equal Pareto frontier (FID ↓ vs. executed blocks ↓ / latency ↓) than (i) full-model inference and (ii) ASE with any hand-crafted schedule.
   H2. Efficiency: For a fixed target quality (≤1% FID degradation from full model) LEES achieves ≥30 % end-to-end speed-up and ≥30 % FLOPs reduction.
   H3. Robustness: Learned gates are stable across random seeds (σ_FID <0.2, σ_blocks <5 %) and under moderate data shifts (e.g., CIFAR-10-C corruption severity 3) quality drops no more than the baselines.
   H4. Generalization & Scalability: A single training recipe (same λ-grid, 1-epoch fine-tune) works for diverse datasets (CIFAR-10 32², CelebA-HQ 64², ImageNet 256²) and backbones (DDPM-UNet, ADM, LDM-512), preserving ≥80 % of H1/H2 gains.
   H5. Minimal Overhead: The optimisation of 2·K scalar gate parameters converges within 5 % of the total cost of one standard diffusion fine-tuning epoch.

2. Comparative Framework
   2.1 Baselines
       B1 Full model (no skipping).
       B2 ASE default linear schedule.
       B3 ASE tuned by exhaustive grid-search (upper bound on manual tuning).
   2.2 Ablations
       A1 Hard vs. soft gating (straight-through vs. continuous mask at inference).
       A2 Removing cost term (λ = 0) to isolate regulariser effect.
       A3 Fixed, random initialisation of φ without training (measures learning benefit).
   2.3 State-of-the-Art Alternatives
       S1 Progressive distillation (DDIM---PD).
       S2 Latent-diffusion fast samplers (L-DM + fewer steps).
       Only speed/quality results reported; these help position LEES on the broader method landscape.

3. Evaluation Angles
   Quantitative
     • Quality: FID, Inception Score, CLIP-FID (for ImageNet 256²), human 2-AFC (small panel).
     • Efficiency: Wall-clock time per batch, images/s, GPU-FLOPs (NVProf), energy (nvidia-smi --query-power).
     • Robustness: ΔFID on CIFAR-10-C, CelebA with added JPEG artefacts.
     • Stability: mean±std over 5 seeds.
   Qualitative
     • Side-by-side samples at equal compute budgets.
     • Heat-maps of gate σ(α_k t+β_k) over time vs. block depth.
     • Pareto plots (FID vs. compute) with 95 %-CI bands.

4. Experimental Matrix
   Datasets × Backbones × λ-grid (0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) × 5 seeds.
   For each cell: train φ once, then measure metrics above at 50, 25, 15 sampling steps (to test interaction with solver length).
   Total GPU budget fits in one A100 80 GB node (<3 weeks) by data-parallel batching and freezing main weights.

5. Success Criteria
   • LEES dominates B1/B2 on the Pareto frontier in ≥80 % of experiment cells.
   • At a matched quality point (ΔFID≤1 %) LEES delivers ≥30 % compute saving versus B2 and ≥40 % versus B1 on all datasets.
   • Ablations A1–A3 underperform full LEES by ≥5 % in either FID or speed, confirming each component’s necessity.
   • Gate distributions converge (KL divergence <0.05 between last two checkpoints) within 10 % of total fine-tune time.
   • Under data shift, LEES’s ΔFID is ≤B2’s ΔFID.
   • Results are statistically significant (paired t-test, p<0.05) over seeds.

6. Reporting & Transparency
   • Release code, logs, trained φ for every dataset/backbone.
   • Provide a reproducibility script that re-generates key plots on an A100 or a 3090 (auto-detect GPU).
   • Document energy usage to contextualise efficiency claims.

This unified strategy ensures that every subsequent experiment tests LEES comprehensively—across quality, efficiency, robustness, and generalisation—against strong baselines and ablations, using consistent success criteria and leveraging the available high-end compute environment.
